(* by transformation we expect it to build in multiple phases due to how
   traversal works

   1st phase resolves everything that is not a function
   for every parameters that are functions, build a wrapped version
   replace all their references into the corresponding wrapped version

   let run_function =
     let module Local = struct
       type _ Effect.t += CheckParam_x : int -> unit Effect.t
       type _ Effect.t += CheckReturn : int -> unit Effect.t

       (* body of run_function *)
       f_wrapped x
     with
     | res -> res
     | effect AllowedEffects, k -> ...

     | effect e, k ->
       match e with
       | CheckParam_x v ->
           let checked = match pred_x with
           | AllowedEffectsInContract -> ...
           in
           if checked
           then continue k ()
           else discontinue k (Blame "?")

    2nd phase expands wrapped versions using the same logic
    repeated until all functions appearing as argument are wrapped
    exception: if the user don't specify the contract, then we don't attach
    contract handler

    effects scoping clashing each other? will try with multi-layer and see
    but I expect that it is not gonna happen because each of them
    uses a different handler

    we only get problem when using handler inside a handler
